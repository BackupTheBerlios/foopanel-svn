+-------------------------------+

This plugin provides an panel menu built from Freedesktop.org's ".desktop" 
entries: it is similar to the Xfce panel, as you have a button for each
category, but it is build dinamically like the Gnome menu (of which it shares
the settings, so you can edit this menu with a menu-editor for Gnome).

It requires PyXDG (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fpyxdg),
in addiction to Foopanel requirements.
